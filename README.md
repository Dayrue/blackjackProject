# blackjackProject
The goal of this project was to create a program that simulates games of blackjack, stores them in a database, and uses those stored games to make recommendations based on previously played games. 
The requirements for this project were:
  - The application must be able to create, read, update, and delete data
  - Use at least 3 different tables
  - The tables must have at least 50 records
  - The tables must have a primary/foreign key relationship

The libraries I used were:
  - Pygame to create the game visuals and make it playable
  - Random to help generate cards dealt for the game as well as actions taken by the player
  - mysql.connector to connect the data with a mySQL database
